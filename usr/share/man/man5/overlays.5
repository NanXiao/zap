.SH NAME
overlays - collections of installed packages
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Tribblix uses the SVR4 packaging system to manage installed software
packages. However, this does not provide a very useful level of
abstraction, and it is recommended that users and administrators
manage installed software at a higher level, using overlays.
.LP
An overlay is a group of packages that are installed together, that
provides a meaningful set of functionality. Overlays are managed using
the zap(1) utility.
