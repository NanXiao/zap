ZAP and locales
===============

The zap utility allows you to add and remove locales.

The syntax is

zap add-locale name [name...]

or

zap remove-locale name [name...]

The names recognized are the 2 (or occasionally 3) letter code for the
locale, or its descriptive name or variants thereof.

Generally, if there's a corresponding set of extra locales then those
will be added or removed by this subcommand too.

To see what locale packages are available:

zap list-locales

You can also see what locale packages are currently installed, and also
which locales are available as a result:

zap installed-locales
