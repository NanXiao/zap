  repository and save it or them to the local cache

install [-R dir] [-s dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will install the package or packages specified. The
  -R flag allows you to specify an alternate root for installation, the
  -s flag allows you to specify a local directory containing packages
  (for example, the CD).

  This subcommand will update the given package(s) to the latest
  available version.
