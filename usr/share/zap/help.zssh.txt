Connect to a zone with SSH
==========================

In order to connect to a zone with ssh, it's first necessary to work
out what its IP address is. Fortunately, zap can do the work for you.

To connect to a zone with ssh, you can use the command:

  zap zssh zone_name

or, to use a specific username:

  zap zssh user_name@zone_name

This will log you in to an interactive session; if you simply wish to
run a command or commands, simply append them, for example:

  zap zssh zone_name uname -a

If the zone you're trying to connect to is on a private subnet behind
a router zone, zssh will use the router zone as a jumphost.

There's one flag, -T will create a tunnel over the given port. This
can be useful to tunnel VNC, for example:

  zap zssh -T 5901 zone_name
