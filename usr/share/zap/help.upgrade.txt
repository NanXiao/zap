ZAP upgrades
============

The zap utility can upgrade a system to a newer release.

In this process:

 - a new boot environment is created using beadm

 - the version of zap appropriate to the new release is installed in
   the alternate boot environment

 - all the overlays and packages in the alternate boot environment are
   updated

 - the alternate boot environment is activated and booted into

The syntax of the upgrade subcommand is:

upgrade list

  Will list known versions that can be upgraded to, and which is the
  current version

upgrade current

  Will display the current release version.

upgrade version

  Will perform the upgrade. The default is to create a new boot
  environment matching the initial release of the new version and to
  not reboot into it.

upgrade -B version

  If the -B flag is supplied, automatically reboot into the new boot
  environment once the upgrade is complete.
