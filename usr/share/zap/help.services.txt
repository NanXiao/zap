ZAP and SMF services
====================

The zap utility can enable and disable SMF services associated with an
overlay. The possible zap subcommands related to services are:

list-services overlay_name

  Will list any services declared by an overlay.

show-services overlay_name

  Will show the status (using the svcs command) of those services
  declared by an overlay.

enable-services overlay_name

  Will synchronously enable all services declared by an overlay, in the
  order they are declared. Any services required as dependencies will
  also be enabled.

disable-services overlay_name

  Will synchronously disable all services declared by an overlay, in the
  reverse order they are declared. Note that any services enabled in order
  to satisfy dependencies will not be automatically disabled.
