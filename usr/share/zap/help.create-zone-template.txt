ZAP and zone templates
======================

The zap utility allows you to create template zones to a given
specification which can then be used to create sparse root zones.

The syntax of the subcommand is:

create-zone-template [-t whole|alien] -T template_name
  [-o overlay] [-O overlay] [-I image_file]

Supplying the template_name is mandatory; other arguments are optional.

The -t flag specifies the type of template zone. The default (whole)
is to construct a whole-root template based on the global zone.
Alternatively, with the alien type, it is possible to create a
template from an image in the same way as an alien-root zone is
created.

The -T flag specifies the name of a template. Once constructed, this
template can be used as the argument to the -T flag of 'zap
create-zone' to construct real zones using this template.

The -o flag specifies an overlay to be installed in the template file
system. This flag can be used multiple times to require multiple
overlays. The effect of listing overlays here is that the template is
created from the global zone and only contains the subset of the
packages that are contained in the given overlays; specifying an
overlay that is not present in the global zone will generate an
error.

The -O flag specifies an overlay to be added to the template. This flag
can be used multiple times to add multiple overlays. Unlike the -o flag
which specifies that the template contains a subset of the packages in
the global zone, the -O flag adds extra packages, and does not require
the overlays or packages to be present in the global zone.

The -I flag specifies an image for an alien template. For an alien
template, the -I flag is required, and the -o and -O flags must not be
used.

A note on implementation: the templates can be found under
/export/zone-templates.
