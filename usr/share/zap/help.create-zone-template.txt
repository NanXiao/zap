ZAP and zone creation
=====================

The zap utility allows you to create zones with a given specification
and control the software installed in the zone.

The syntax of the subcommand is:

create-zone-template -T template_name [-d extra_dir] [-o overlay] [-O overlay]

Supplying the template_name is mandatory; other arguments are optional.

The -T flag specifies the name of a template. Once constructed, this
template can be used as the argument to the -T flag of 'zap
create-zone' to construct real zones using this template.

The -d flag specifies a directory to be created and mounted inside the
zone. This flag can be used multiple times to create multiple
directories in the zone.

The -o flag specifies an overlay to be installed in the template file
system. This flag can be used multiple times to require multiple
overlays. The effect of listing overlays here is that the template is
created from the global zone and only contains the subset of the
packages that are contained in the given overlays; specifying an
overlay that is not present in the global zone will generate an
error.

The -O flag specifies an overlay to be added to the template. This flag
can be used multiple times to add multiple overlays. Unlike the -o flag
which specifies that the template contains a subset of the packages in
the global zone, the -O flag adds extra packages, and does not require
the overlays or packages to be present in the global zone.

A note on implementation: the templates can be found under
/export/zone-templates.
