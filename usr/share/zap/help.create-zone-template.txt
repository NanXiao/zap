ZAP and zone templates
======================

The zap utility allows you to create zone templates to a given
specification which can then be used to create sparse root zones.

The syntax of the subcommand is:

create-zone-template [-t whole|alien] -T template_name
  [-I image_file] [-o overlay] [-O overlay] [-p package] [-P package]

Supplying the template_name is mandatory; other arguments are optional.

The -t flag specifies the type of template zone. The default (whole)
is to construct a whole-root template based on the global zone.
Alternatively, with the alien type, it is possible to create a
template from an image in the same way as an alien-root zone is
created. Note that the type here only determines how the template is
constructed; all zones created from the template will be sparse.

The -T flag specifies the name of a template. Once constructed, this
template can be used as the argument to the -T flag of 'zap
create-zone' to construct real zones using this template.

The -o flag specifies an overlay to be installed in the template file
system. This flag can be used multiple times to require multiple
overlays. The effect of listing overlays here is that the template is
created from the global zone and only contains the subset of the
packages that are contained in the given overlays; specifying an
overlay that is not present in the global zone will generate an
error.

The -O flag specifies an overlay to be added to the template. This flag
can be used multiple times to add multiple overlays. Unlike the -o flag
which specifies that the template contains a subset of the packages in
the global zone, the -O flag adds extra packages, and does not require
the overlays or packages to be present in the global zone.

The -p flag specifies a package to be copied to the template. This
flag can be used multiple times to copy multiple packages. The use of
this flag requires the -o flag to be used, and allows you to copy
individual packages into the template.

The -P flag specifies a package to be added to the template. This flag
can be used multiple times to add multiple packages. Unlike the -p
flag which copies a package from the global zone, the -P flag adds
extra packages, and does not require the package to be present in the
global zone.

The -I flag specifies an image for an alien template. For an alien
template, the -I flag is required, and the -o, -O, -p and -P flags
must not be used.

To list current zone templates, use the following command

    zap list-zone-templates [-p]

which will list all existing templates, the path to the template
image, and any zones using that template. With the -p flag, gives
parsable output.

To create a zone from a template, supply the name of the template as
the argument to the -T flag to 'zap create-zone'.

To remove a template, and its files, run

    zap destroy-zone-template [-n] -T template_name

This will fail if any zones are using the template. With the -n flag,
show what would be done without doing it.

A note on implementation: the templates can be found under
/export/zone-templates.
