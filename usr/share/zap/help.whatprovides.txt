What package do I need for a given file?
========================================

Some other package systems allow you to search for a given pathname,
to find which package you need to install.

The basic syntax is:

zap whatprovides [-p] search-term

If the -p flag is used, the search will be for the given absolute
pathname.

If the search term is a simple word, the search will be for that as a
file.

If the search term looks like a library (starts with "lib") then the
search is for the allowed forms of a shared library name.

The index files used by whatprovides may need to be downloaded before
this command can be used. To do that, run the following as root:

zap refresh-filelist
