Setting the hostname
====================

The default hostname is "tribblix", but you can set it to a name of
your choosing. To do so:

    zap set-hostname new-name

If you want your system to be accessible on the local network via
multicast dns, so that other systems can connect to it using the name
"new-name.local", then add the -m flag:

    zap set-hostname -m new-name

In this case, you still need to supply a hostname, to avoid accidental
duplication of names on the local network.
