Mirroring ZAP repositories
==========================

You can mirror a package or overlay repository with zap. The subcommand
comes in 2 forms:

zap copy-package-repo repo dest_dir

or

zap copy-package-repo repo_url dest_dir

for package repositories; similarly 'zap copy-overlay-repo' will mirror
an overlay repository.

If you use the first form to specify a repository by name (such as illumos
or tribblix) it will use the current system to resolve that to a url. This
is not necessarily constant between platforms or versions, so it's better
to specify the url explicitly.

The destination directory specified by dest_dir must be an absolute path.
If it exists, it is expected to contain at least the catalog from a
previous run; in that case running the command again will update the
local copy of the repository.

All package files downloaded are verified for both size and checksum
against the catalog.
