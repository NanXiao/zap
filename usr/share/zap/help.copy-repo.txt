Mirroring ZAP repositories
==========================

You can mirror a repo with zap. The subcommand comes in 2 forms:

copy-repo repo dest_dir

or

copy-repo repo_url dest_dir

If you specify a repo (such as illumos or tribblix) it will use the
current system to resolve that to a url. This is not necessarily
constant between platforms or versions, so it's better to specify the
url explicitly.

The dest_dir must be an absolute path. If it exists, it is expected to
contain at least the catalog from a previous run; in that case running
copy-repo again will update the copy of the repo.

All files downloaded are verified for both size and checksum against
the catalog.
