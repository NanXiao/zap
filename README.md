ZAP

Zip Archive Packaging

In Tribblix, installed software is managed using the zap utility. Other
administrative operations, especially those that involve software
selection and installation (for example, managing zone configuration)
can also use zap.

Under etc are configuration files for the repositories.

The scripts all live in usr/lib/zap, with usr/bin/zap being the main
driver.
